# BACK-END (PYTHON)
## Hello. Thanks for being a part of this wonderful team.
We're building <strong>GIGS</strong> - A website where creators of art (e.g: writers, digital creators, etc)can upload their work and make money from it. For the Nigerian and African creator at large.

- To get started, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo">fork</a> this repo (this gives you a copy of the repo on your personal github account) <br>
- To work with this your now personal copy of the repo, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository">clone</a> the repo to your local PC <br>
- Feel free to work on and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-push-an-existing-project-to-github">push</a> changes to the development branch (or any new branch you <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/how-to-create-a-new-branch-in-github/">create</a>) <br>
- Upon successful completion of your assigned task, submit a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">Pull Request</a> which will then be reviewed by the Team Lead and/or mentors before it is either merged or rejected <br>

### Some extra things to keep in mind while coding
Write code for:
1. Readability
- Imagine the person reviewing your code has an axe and knows your house address
3. Modularity
- How easy is it to reuse bits of your code?
- When you have an error, how easy is it to narrow down to the exact section of code that's responsible for a problem
4. Efficiency
- How fast does this work?
5. Length
